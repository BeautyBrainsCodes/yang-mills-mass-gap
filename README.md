# Yang-Mills Mass Gap ‚Äî Discrete Topological Theory  
Author: Selena Marquez

This repository contains the original theoretical work, simulations, and visual proofs for a new approach to solving the Yang-Mills mass gap problem using discrete vector fields and topological self-interaction.

## What‚Äôs Included
- `Selena_Marquez_YangMills_MassGap_Proof.pdf`: Full research proof with theorem and 4D simulation evidence.
- `simulation_1D.py` to `simulation_4D.py`: Python files for reproducing the vector field simulations in 1D through 4D.
- `yang_mills_mass_gap_energy_plot.png`: Graph showing persistent energy (mass gap) in the 4D model.

## Summary
Using nonlinear cross-product field rules on discrete SU(2)-like lattices, this model demonstrates emergent confinement behavior and localized energy blobs ‚Äî evidence of a mass gap without any explicit mass term.

## Simulation
Each script simulates a different dimensionality. Run with:
```bash
python simulation_4D.py
```
